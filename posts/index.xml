    <description><![CDATA[No Plex Zone 8 years ago I started No Plex Zone. It was a great foray into building my own home lab and learning Linux. I initially just wanted to watch movies and shows in my college campus, and before long my friends asked me if they could also watch stuff on my Plex server too. I happily obliged and manually grabbed new releases when asked. This process quickly became unsustainable.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s been a long while since I&rsquo;ve updated this blog - almost 4 years. During this time I&rsquo;ve grown immensely and there were many things worth posting here. Unfortunately I neglected maintaining my personal blog to the point where the main domain doesn&rsquo;t even work.
I started a personal project recently that inspired me to start blogging again, until I saw this disaster.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Over a year has passed since I&rsquo;ve last done anything related to penetration testing. I decided to tackle the SwagShop machine on HackTheBox to ease back into things since it has a nice friendly green &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; rating. Note: This post is hidden until the machine is &ldquo;Retired&rdquo; to avoid spoilers to the community.</p>]]></description>

    <title>How A Cryptocurrency Miner Made Its Way onto Our Internal Kubernetes Clusters</title>
    <link>https://bchoy.me/posts/2018-09-20-kubernetes-crypto-miner/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Medium post: <a href="https://medium.com/jw-player-engineering/how-a-cryptocurrency-miner-made-its-way-onto-our-internal-kubernetes-clusters-9b09c4704205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://medium.com/jw-player-engineering/how-a-cryptocurrency-miner-made-its-way-onto-our-internal-kubernetes-clusters-9b09c4704205</a></p>
<p>The explosion of cryptocurrency in recent years spurred a wave of exploits targeting unsuspecting machines to mine cryptocurrency for the attackers. Earlier in the year, the JW Player DevOps team discovered one of the aforementioned miners running on our development and staging Kubernetes clusters.</p>
<p>To be clear, <em>our production cluster was not affected, no JW Player customer data was accessed or exposed, and service was uninterrupted</em>. Malicious actors are not always intent on stealing information or taking a website down, they can be just as content (or more so) in stealing your compute power. We take any intrusion very seriously though, and wanted to share our findings to help other DevOps teams harden their systems.</p>
<p>This blog post is broken up into several parts detailing — discovery and diagnosis, our immediate response, discovering and replicating the attack vector, damage assessment, and plans for preventative measures to further protect our systems.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Following up on my Bandit post, <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">OverTheWire Natas</a> teaches the basics of serverside web-security. These are quick notes for my solutions to level 0-10. I&rsquo;ll be doing these in preperation for the OSCP pentesting course I plan on taking.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">OverTheWire Bandit</a> is a capture the flag (CTF) game for beginners. I&rsquo;ve recently regained interest in security and found this a fun way to get back into what originally led me to learn programming. These are quick notes for my solutions on level 0-27.</p>
<h2 id="level-0---level-1">Level 0 -&gt; Level 1</h2>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Creating a Docker Workflow with Node.js</title>
    <link>https://bchoy.me/posts/2016-02-28-creating-a-docker-workflow-with-nodejs/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note:</strong> These are my findings after working with Docker, Jenkins, and AWS for only 2-3 months. This post details my thought process for the workflow I have set up with Docker and was written to document my progress. However, it might be useful for other beginners who are interested in setting up a better workflow for development with Node.js and Docker.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our development team occasionally has to switch between different projects. Each project has its own set of dependencies requiring a specific version of Node.js, npm, and/or Ruby to be run. Using nvm and rvm can mitigate the issue, but constantly switching between versions is a hassle and it is easy to lose track of which version you&rsquo;re currently using. Time is also wasted on debugging environment inconsistencies between local development machines, and even more time is lost solving cross-platform issues when deploying to the dev/qa/prod servers (OSX to Linux). Many hours were lost for both the development and system administration teams debugging these issues; hours that could instead be spent improving the current project or working on other projects.</p>]]></description>
