It was a
Nintendo 64. Since then I&rsquo;ve been enamored with video games and have served as
both a source of entertainment and the foundation of my passion for programming.</p><h3 id=middle-school---programming-baby-steps>Middle School - Programming Baby Steps</h3><h4 id=newgrounds---flash-and-actionscript>Newgrounds - Flash and ActionScript</h4><p>Newgrounds was immensely popular when I was growing up. It was the first user
generated content site I was exposed to and inspired me to learn ActionScript to
submit my own game. I also invested time in learning Macromedia DreamWeaver to
create my own website, though I would not succeed until much later.</p><h4 id=grand-theft-auto-vice-city---scm>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - SCM</h4><p>GTA:VC released on PC in 2002 after finishing the single-player campaign, I
found a multiplayer mod called Multi Theft Auto: Vice City. There was no
premise other than allowing players to gather in the massive open world. The
community quickly started grouping up, forming alliances for gang fights,
organised races, stunt performances, and joyriding. One day the fun was ruined
by someone in a helicopter clipping through walls and instantly killing anyone
they collided with. More people popped up both invincible and moving at
impossible speeds. It was the first time I encountered cheats. One of the
cheaters I spoke to introduced me to basic anti-cheat - bypassing CRC checks for
trainers by hex editing. Soon afterwards, I learned how to program in
<a href=https://gtamods.com/wiki/SCM_language target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">SCM</a>, GTA&rsquo;s scripting language, to
create my own mods and cheats.</p><h4 id=neopets---swf-decompilation-and-cheat-engine>NeoPets - SWF Decompilation and Cheat Engine</h4><p>Following my exposure to Flash games from Newgrounds, through a SWF decompiler,
Neopets taught me how games operated on a deeper level. After gaining a lower
level understanding of how a game functioned, I moved on to learning Cheat
Engine and made simple memory modifications to earn more Neopoints in several
games.</p><h3 id=high-school---first-real-foray-into-game-hacking>High School - First Real Foray Into Game Hacking</h3><h4 id=gunbound---cheat-engine-and-ollydbg>GunBound - Cheat Engine and OllyDbg</h4><p>GunBound came out during a time where people started coming together to form
communities where people discussed and released different ways to hack the game.
I participated in several forums and IRC channels, and started really making
headway understanding how computers and desktop applications worked on a lower
level. Using Cheat Engine and OllyDbg, I was able to debug the game to gain a
deeper understanding of how it worked and produce cheats such as 1 hit ko, god
mode, and infinite item usage.</p><p>More advanced anti-cheat also meant simple hex editing would not suffice to make
use of the tools I was accustomed to. I learned many ways to circumvent nProtect
GameGuard, such as redirecting their servers to &ldquo;update&rdquo; from localhost through
modifying the <code>hosts</code> file. Alongside that I learned more about web development
and was able to write client side JavaScript to perform actions such as add
gold to my account.</p><h4 id=maplestory---assembly-language-botting-and-packet-editing>MapleStory - Assembly Language, Botting, and Packet Editing</h4><p>MapleStory, being an MMORPG, introduced me to bots and more advanced methods of
using Cheat Engine. I starting sharing more of my discoveries amongst the
community after gaining a better understanding of Assembly Language (ASM) and
writing my own bots starting with Visual Basic and AutoHotkey. I was also
introduced to packet editing through Windows Packet Editor (WPE) and began to
understand how information was passed through the internet. Even more advanced
anti-cheat also meant I learned more ways it can be circumvented, such as
replicating the memory for nProtect to read from whilst the real game memory was
being modified through Cheat Engine.</p><h4 id=counter-strike-16---amx-mod-x-and-c>Counter-Strike 1.6 - Amx Mod X and C++</h4><p>I absolutely loved this game. These were the good &lsquo;ol days where the community
would host their own servers instead of nowadays where we would play on company
owned ones. This meant the modding community was thriving, and one of my
favourite serves had a <a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=200169" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Pokemon mod</a>,
prompting me to learn <a href=https://github.com/alliedmodders/amxmodx target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">AMX Mod X</a> to
develop plugins for my own dedicated server. I didn&rsquo;t make anything notable but
it was still a fun project.</p><p>I also gained interest in the cheating scene for an FPS. There were primarily
wallhacks and aimbots. The source code for one of the dominant cheats called
OGC was released or leaked. This was when I learned the basics of C++ and OpenGL
to write my first very basic cheat.</p><h4 id=back-to-web-development>Back to Web Development</h4><p>Being part of several communities, I also wanted to create one. I started off
learning how forums operated through phpBB, vBulletin, and Invision Power Board.
I purchased web hosting and learned how to host my own website and write PHP
plugins to customise the (now defunct) sites I launched - MapleBound, CSBound,
and CompactGaming. CSBound failed because I had no good releases to draw people
in, however MapleBound and CompactGaming were successful due to me being able to
release cheats for GunBound and MapleStory. My friends and I started a premium
cheat subscription where subscribers will receive the latest private undetected
hacks. We also didn&rsquo;t want the software cracked so we invested time on how to
obfuscate the binary. CompactGaming was an all purpose forum reaching 10,000
members at peak and was monetised through Google AdSense.</p><h3 id=college-and-afterwards>College and Afterwards</h3><p>My personal growth started shifting away from game hacking as a hobby to
receiving a proper education in computer science and preparing myself for a
career.</p><h4 id=risk-of-rain-2-among-us-phasmophobia-fall-guys---c>Risk of Rain 2, Among Us, Phasmophobia, Fall Guys - C#</h4><p><a href=https://unity.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Unity</a> is a popular game framework, which is easily
decompiled through <a href=https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">dnSpy</a>. Cheat Engine
has also advanced to utilise <a href="https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Mono" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Mono</a>,
which is the framework that powers scripting in Unity. Despite not knowing C# or
spending time learning it, it was intuitive enough for me to pick up and write
simple modifications to the game.</p><h4 id=oscp>OSCP</h4><p><a href=https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">OSCP</a> is a penetration testing
course and certification. While taking the course, I learned how to infiltrate
networks, find vulnerabilities in software, write malicious payloads, and gain
root access to machines. It is an excellent course and the knowledge gained is
invaluable as someone who needs to be security minded for work.</p></div></div></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/CreativeWork><i class="far fa-copyright fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i><span itemprop=copyrightYear>2015 - 2024</span><span class=author itemprop=copyrightHolder>&nbsp;<a href=https://bchoy.me target=_blank>Brian Choy</a></span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>
