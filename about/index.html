<p>Simply put, video games. I absolutely love video games and to this day it is
still a large part of my identity.</p>
<h3 id="childhood-gaming">Childhood Gaming</h3>
<p>When I was a kid my parents rented my first console from BlockBuster to keep me
entertained. It was a Nintendo 64 and I loved it. Renting was a horrible idea,
costing like $50 a day and whatever amount for games. I was glued to the screen
to try to beat a game before my parents had to return it.</p>
<h3 id="middle-school---programming-baby-steps">Middle School - Programming Baby Steps</h3>
<h4 id="newgrounds">NewGrounds</h4>
<p>Fast-forward to 11 years old, NewGrounds was immensely popular (and probably the
worst thing to expose a kid to at the time). I would go to the library to watch
as much as possible and best of all, there were games and they were free. As an
active participant of the site, I decided I wanted to contribute and submit my
content. Inspired by stick figure fighting videos and the Madness Combat games,
I learned ActionScript to create my first MegaMan fighting animation and
submitted it. It was complete garbage and disheartening to receive a 1.x rating
and eventually got &ldquo;blammed&rdquo; and removed from the content portal.</p>
<h4 id="web-development-attempt-1">Web Development Attempt #1</h4>
<p>Today I still don&rsquo;t have a knack for creating media and am not really bothered
by it, but as a 12 year old I was highly discouraged and pivoted over to creating
my very own NewGrounds site, I downloaded each <code>.html</code> page and attempted to
modify it. After failing miserably I hopped over to the library and picked up a
bunch of library books to learn MacroMedia Dreamweaver. It then occurred to me
that web development was actually pretty complex. So I settled for a GeoCities
site instead.</p>

        </div>

<h4 id="grand-theft-auto-vice-city---first-programming-language-scm">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - First Programming Language (SCM)</h4>
<p>Another thing parents shouldn&rsquo;t let their kids view or play. GTA:VC released on
PC in 2002 and like everyone else, I absolutely loved it. A multiplayer mod was
released and I thoroughly enjoyed messing around with other players after
finishing the single player campaign. The premise was to gun each other down,
and eventually people started grouping up to have gang fights, organise races,
and perform stunts. One day someone clipped through all the walls in a map with
a helicopter and killed everyone they collided with. Then people started started
reaching impossible speeds, or were unable to die. This is the first time I
encountered cheats.</p>
<p>I started talking more to the helicopter guy, asking how it was possible to run
cheats and after much arrogance, he introduced me to hex editing the client to
remove the anti-cheat protection. After bypassing anti-cheat, I started
programming in <a href="https://gtamods.com/wiki/SCM_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">SCM</a>, GTA&rsquo;s scripting
language, to create my own mods/cheats.</p>
<h4 id="neopets---memory-editing-and-flash-decompilation">NeoPets - Memory Editing and Flash Decompilation</h4>
<p>Most of my peers started playing NeoPets and I joined in on the action. Many of
the tasks involved logging in daily and navigating to various locations to
collect rewards. You can also play games to earn NeoPoints and buy/sell items on
the marketplace to earn more. After being exposed to cheating on GTA:VC, I
downloaded every cheat I found on Google and infected my computer with like 10
rootkits and destroyed my computer. Learning from my mistakes, I decided to
learn how to hack the game properly through Cheat Engine for memory editing
alongside a SWF decompiler to understand more of how the game functioned. I
probably ruined my reward system permanently because I got used to instantly
reaching the result (lots of NeoPoints) without putting in any work of playing
the games every day to maximise my earnings.</p>
<h3 id="high-school---first-real-foray-into-hacking">High School - First Real Foray Into Hacking</h3>
<h4 id="gunbound---javascript-memory-editing-anti-cheat-bypass">GunBound - JavaScript, Memory Editing, Anti-Cheat Bypass</h4>
<p>GunBound, basically a Worms clone, was the must-play game at the time and
actually had decent anti-cheat (nProtect GameGuard). The hacking community was
gaining traction with many forums and IRC channels springing up. With more
resources, this is where I really started making headway into understanding how
computers and code on a lower level.</p>
<p>Simple hex editing didn&rsquo;t cut it and the anti-cheat blocked memory editors,
meaning I had to find a way around it. It&rsquo;s been many years so I forgot exactly
how they were done but one of my more notable memories was modifying the system
<code>hosts</code> file to redirect GameGuard&rsquo;s servers to a locally running webserver to
grab the latest &ldquo;updates&rdquo;. Meaning we were able to create bogus files to render
the anti-cheat useless.</p>
<p>Alongside hacking the game itself, their website had several security flaws. One
of which was allowing gold to be rewarded upon completing certain actions. I
discovered that by executing custom JavaScript, I was able to generate gold
infinitely due to them having no server-side checks.</p>
<h4 id="maplestory---assembly-language-botting-packet-editing-lua">MapleStory - Assembly Language, Botting, Packet Editing, LUA</h4>
<p>MapleStory is where I started making a name for myself. I shared my discoveries
amongst the community and released multiple cheat tables for Cheat Engine. To
do so, I learned Assembly Language (ASM), which is probably the most difficult
thing to start with, but I didn&rsquo;t know any better at the time and it was
necessary to understand what exactly was happening in memory. At the same time,
anti-cheat got more advanced where the game would check to see if the memory
was being edited and crash the game if so. Additionally, botting had several
arbitrary checks to disconnect you if you were detected.</p>
<p>Though my skills improved considerably, I wasn&rsquo;t good enough to understand how
to bypass the anti-cheat on my own. Many thanks to the community for releasing
methods such as forcing nProtect to read from a replicated memory table whilst
the real memory was being edited by Cheat Engine, allowing me to focus on
debugging the game and creating cheats such as VAC hacks. The site I contributed
to the most no longer exists, but good thing someone cross-posted some of my
findings to another forum.</p>

<p>Another good thing is I decided to upload my cheats on YouTube so I have a
visual representation of the effects of the code above.</p>

<p>All this time I&rsquo;ve been using client-side memory editing, until one of my
contacts on IRC showed me the potential of packet editing. Using
<a href="https://winsock-packet-editor-wpe-pro.apponic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">WPE Pro</a> I inspected the
traffic to and from the game server and learned a lot about networking. I didn&rsquo;t
really understand it since networking is complex, however under the tutelage of
my IRC friend, I furthered my exploiting skills and was learning how to do one
of the most desired exploits in MMORPGs, item duplication.</p>
<h4 id="counter-strike-16---amx-mod-x-opengl-c">Counter-Strike 1.6 - AMX Mod X, OpenGL, C++</h4>
<p>These were the good ol days where we could host our own dedicated servers
instead of relying on the current game industry model where all game servers are
hosted by the company, like CS:GO. One of my favourite servers had a
<a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=200169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Pokemon mod</a>, prompting
me to learn <a href="https://github.com/alliedmodders/amxmodx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">AMX Mod X</a> to develop
plugins for my own server. I didn&rsquo;t make anything notable but it was still a fun
project.</p>
<p>I was also playing Counter-Strike 1.6 competitively and any competitive player
will tell you that there&rsquo;s no shortage of cheaters. Valve Anti Cheat (VAC)
wasn&rsquo;t very effective back then and the source code to a popular cheat called
OGC was release, serving as a base for many cheats with wallhacks, aimbot, ESP,
etc. This is when I was first exposed to C++ to make SepheriX, my custom OGC
build. I visited my local library to pick up books on how to create and build a
C++ project, however the library only had outdated books and I couldn&rsquo;t even
wrap my head around how to install C++ or compile anything. Took me weeks to
finally get started, learn how to interact with the Counter-Strike SDK, starting
off with rendering an in-game cheat menu, displaying player names above their
heads (ESP), wallhacks, aimbot vectors, and how recoil/spread was determined.
Looking back I didn&rsquo;t truly learn C++ and was still in script kiddie territory,
but I learned a ton, particularly around OpenGL, Windows internals, and ring0
anti-cheat protection. I&rsquo;m too old to be amused by this now, but at the time one
of the features I was most proud of that no one had implemented before was
changing your in-game name to the player you were aiming at, and constantly
switching so the wrong person would be accused and banned 😅.</p>

<p>My online persona was becoming more and more known amongst the cheating
community and finally gained enough skill to understand how to host a website.
I started off with the forum softwares phpBB and vBulletin, then eventually
settled on Invision Power Board. I created 3 communities around the games I
played - CompactGaming, MapleBound, and CSBound. CSBound was a failure since my
skillset wasn&rsquo;t large enough to successfully draw people to my forum, but
MapleBound and CompactGaming were successful. My friends and I started a premium
cheat subscription where subscribers will receive the latest private undetected
hacks. We also didn&rsquo;t want the software cracked so we invested time on how to
obfuscate the binary. CompactGaming was an all purpose forum reaching 10,000
members at peak and was monetised through Google AdSense.</p>

<p><a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unity</a> is a popular game framework, which is surprisingly
easy to decompile through <a href="https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">dnSpy</a>. Cheat Engine
has also advanced to utilise <a href="https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Mono" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Mono</a>,
which is the framework that powers scripting in Unity. Despite not knowing C#
at all, or learning it, it looks to be a great intuitive language to person
simple tasks such as implementing cheats given my previous limited experience
with C++.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">OSCP</a> is a penetration testing
course and certification. While taking it I learned how to infiltrate networks,
find vulnerabilities in software, and gain root access to machines. It is an
excellent course and the knowledge gained is invaluable as someone who needs to
